Howdy and welcome to my website !

I am a Ph.D. Candidate and Graduate Research Assistant at the Genomics Signal Processing Lab @ the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Texas A&M University, College Station. My background is in electrical engineering and my research focus spans the areas of computational biology, machine learning, statistical modeling and signal processing. You can find all published materials in the publications and on Google Scholars.  

In addition to my research work, I am also passionate about teaching. I have led [ECEN 215] (https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/course-descriptions/ecen/) labs at Texas A&M and have led programming and lecture sessions at the [Texas A&M Data Analytics Club] (https://tamuanalytics.com/). I have also held undergraduate teaching postions with the Department of Physics and Astronomy and Department of Engineering Education at Purdue University, West Lafayette,

My tentative graduation date is May 2022 and I am actively looking for full-time reseach and post doc positions. Please feel to contact me by email. Cheers !!
